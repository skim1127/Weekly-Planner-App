# Weekly-Planner-App
A 7-day planner with checklist functionalities

## Inspiration for the application
- I wanted to create a planner application that also has a checklist functionality. The main purpose of the application is to keep track of any tasks or events that will happen in the next 7 days. However, I also wanted to implement a checklist within the application so that users can easily add tasks that need to be done that aren't necessarily bound to a date.
(Example: checklist of items that one needs for a camping trip.)

## How to use the application
1. Users will be prompted to login on an existing account, or create a new account. Once logged in, they are directed to the homepage.
2. Once at the homepage, Users will be able to see a 7-day calendar, along with a checklist. They can add time-specific events or checklist tasks.
3. Using the Navbar, Users can also navigate to their profile page, checklists page, or 30-day calendar page.
4. The checklists page can contain as many checklists as the users want.

## Technologies used to build the application
1. Front End - React
2. Back End - Sequelize or SQLAlchemy
3. Styling - SASS

## Outstanding Bugs & Unfinished Functionality

## POST-MVP Plans
- Nested checklists(checklist within a checklist)
- Automatically add events/tasks when user specifies it is a weekly/daily occurence
- Show today's weather on the homepage when logged in.
- Desktop notifications/reminders
